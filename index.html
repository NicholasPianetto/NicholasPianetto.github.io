                <p> Wecome to my website! </p>
                <p1> This site is under construction. I intend to use this website as a placeholder for my various
                    projects and will treat it as a blog site.
                    I plan on posting on a wide variety of hardware, since I enjoy vintage computing as well as embedded
                    systems hardware based projects.
                    I plan on dislpaying these numerious projects as I grow as an engineer and will continue to build
                    this website as I gain experience.</p1>

                <p> I wish this were mine =( </p>
                <p1> Here is an example of a vintage computer (not mine, but I wish it was). I enjoy the simplicity of
                    these early
                    home computers, this is an early example of a popular and successful computer. The SOL-20 was an
                    S-100 computer,
                    developed and sold in the mid to late 1970's. It has cool walnut sidings that give the computer such
                    a timeless and
                    classy look.
